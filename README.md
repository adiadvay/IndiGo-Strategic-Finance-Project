# IndiGo Airlines - Strategic Finance & Valuation Case Study
**Project by Adithya Ajith**

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive strategic finance project analyzing the growth prospects of **IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd.)**, India's largest airline. The project was developed to simulate a real-world task performed by an investment banking analyst or strategy consultant.

The core objective was to devise a **data-driven growth strategy** for IndiGo, moving beyond its traditional low-cost carrier model to unlock new revenue streams through **premiumization** and **international expansion**, while maintaining its **industry-leading operational excellence**.

## Key Deliverables
This repository contains two main deliverables:

1. **Financial Model (`IndiGo_DCF_Model.xlsx`)**:  
   A fully integrated, professional-grade 3-statement and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) financial model built in Excel. It projects IndiGo's financials from FY2025 to FY2030 and derives an implied share price.

2. **Strategic Presentation (`indigo_presentation.html`)**:  
   An interactive, single-page web presentation summarizing the strategic recommendations and key financial impacts.
