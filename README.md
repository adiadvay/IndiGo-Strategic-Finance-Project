IndiGo Airlines - Strategic Finance & Valuation Case Study
Project by Adithya Ajith

Project Summary
This repository contains an institutional-quality strategic finance project, simulating an analysis prepared for an investment committee or corporate strategy team. The project conducts a comprehensive valuation of IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd.) and presents a data-driven recommendation for future growth.

The core of this project was to move beyond a simple valuation and answer a critical business question: How can IndiGo leverage its operational strengths to unlock new, profitable growth avenues in the face of domestic market saturation and renewed competition?

The analysis culminates in a formal recommendation for a dual-pronged strategy of targeted international expansion into high-margin "Blue Ocean" routes and the introduction of ancillary "premium" services to boost profitability.

Key Deliverables & Analysis
This repository contains two primary deliverables:

Financial Model (IndiGo_DCF_Model_JPM_Standard.xlsx): A fully-integrated 3-statement financial model and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation, built from the ground up in Excel. The model forecasts financials for a 6-year period (FY25-FY30) and includes detailed schedules for working capital, debt, and capital expenditures, culminating in an implied share price valuation.

Strategic Presentation (indigo_presentation.html): An interactive, single-page digital presentation summarizing the strategic thesis, key financial impacts, and implementation roadmap. This deliverable showcases the ability to distill complex financial analysis into a clear, concise, and compelling narrative for executive stakeholders.

Core Finance Competencies Demonstrated
Financial Modeling & Forecasting:

Construction of a detailed, multi-year 3-statement model (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) based on historical analysis and a robust set of driver-based assumptions.

Ensured model integrity through a self-balancing balance sheet (Balance Check = 0).

Corporate Valuation:

In-depth Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis to determine the intrinsic value of the firm.

Calculated Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for the Cost of Equity.

Calculated Terminal Value using both the Perpetuity Growth Method (PGM) and an Exit Multiple Method (EMM) to create a valuation range.

Business & Financial Strategy:

Conducted market analysis to identify strategic growth opportunities (e.g., "Blue Ocean" route analysis).

Modeled the financial impact of new business initiatives, such as ancillary revenue streams from premium services, and quantified the potential profit uplift.

Demonstrated understanding of key industry metrics (e.g., CASK, Load Factor) and their impact on financial performance.
